Python Classes

__init__ - The method called when the class is initialized / When we create an instance of our class.

self - The instance of the class. We are able to attach properties to that instance.

When creating an instance, leave out the "new" keyword

Dictionary - A standalone set of key / value pairs
- To access properties on a dictionary use square brackets

Object - An instance of a class
- To access properties on a dictionary use dot notation

Abstraction - Using a class we can abstract out the details involved with interacting with our class. And then we can think in high level terms.
